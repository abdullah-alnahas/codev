# v1.6.0 Gothic

Released: 2026-01-07

## Summary

Gothic introduces the **BUGFIX protocol** for streamlined issue-driven bug fixes, establishes a **release candidate workflow** for future releases, and brings numerous dashboard and CLI improvements. Named after Gothic cathedral architecture - soaring ambition built incrementally by many hands, with flying buttresses (like worktrees) enabling the main structure to reach higher.

## New Features

- **BUGFIX Protocol** (Spec 0065): New lightweight protocol for GitHub issue-driven bug fixes
  - `af spawn --issue 42` - Spawn a builder directly from a GitHub issue
  - `af cleanup --issue 42` - Clean up after merge
  - Uses GitHub Issues as source of truth (no spec/plan files needed)
  - Ideal for isolated fixes under 300 LOC

- **Release Candidate Workflow**: Starting with v1.7.0, minor releases will use RC workflow
  - `npm install @cluesmith/codev@next` for pre-release testing
  - Patch releases (1.6.1, 1.6.2) go direct to stable for backports
  - Full documentation in release protocol

- **Create File Button**: Dashboard file browser now has a "+" button to create new files
  - Quick path buttons for common locations (codev/specs/, codev/plans/, src/)
  - Path traversal protection built-in

## Improvements

- **Tower subcommands**: `af tower start`, `af tower stop`, `af tower status` with better logging
- **Smart close confirmation**: Skip confirmation dialog for shells that have already exited
- **Skeleton completeness**: `codev adopt` now includes cheatsheet.md and lifecycle.md
- **Doctor improvements**: Better error messages for Codex CLI, warning details in summary
- **Spec compliance**: Enhanced guidance for builders on following specs exactly

## Bug Fixes

- Fix symlink path traversal vulnerability in create file API
- Fix broken image reference in cheatsheet template
- Fix config.json being overwritten during `codev update`
- Fix orphan cleanup only killing architect sessions with dead PIDs
- Fix remote port registry handling for multi-project support

## Infrastructure

- MAINTAIN run 0005: Updated arch.md with BUGFIX protocol documentation
- 128 E2E tests (127 passing, 1 flaky test infrastructure issue)
- 337 unit tests passing

## Breaking Changes
