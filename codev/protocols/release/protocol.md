# RELEASE Protocol

> **Important**: This protocol is **specific to the Codev project itself**. It lives only in `codev/protocols/` and is intentionally NOT included in `codev-skeleton/`. It serves as an example of how projects can create custom protocols tailored to their specific needs.

> **Role**: This protocol is executed by the **Architect**, not by Builders. Releases are high-level coordination tasks that should not be delegated to isolated worktrees.

The RELEASE protocol is used when preparing a new version of Codev for publication to npm.

## When to Use

Use RELEASE when:
- A set of features has been integrated and validated
- You're ready to publish a new npm package version
- The projectlist shows no work in `implementing`, `implemented`, or `committed` status

## Pre-Release Checklist

### 1. Pre-flight Checks

```bash
# Ensure everything is committed and pushed
git status
git push

# Verify no running builders
af status

# Check for incomplete work
grep -E "status: (implementing|implemented|committed)" codev/projectlist.md
```

**Stop if**: There are uncommitted changes, running builders, or incomplete projects.

### 2. Run MAINTAIN Cycle

Execute the MAINTAIN protocol to ensure:
- Dead code is removed
- Documentation is current (arch.md, lessons-learned.md)
- CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md are in sync

```bash
# Review what MAINTAIN will do
cat codev/protocols/maintain/protocol.md
```

### 3. Run E2E Tests

```bash
bats tests/e2e/
```

**Stop if**: Any tests fail. Fix issues before proceeding.

### 4. Update Version and Tag

```bash
cd packages/codev

# Bump version (choose one)
npm version patch --no-git-tag-version  # Bug fixes only
npm version minor --no-git-tag-version  # New features
npm version major --no-git-tag-version  # Breaking changes

# Commit and tag
cd ../..
git add packages/codev/package.json packages/codev/package-lock.json
git commit -m "Release @cluesmith/codev@X.Y.Z (Codename)"
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z Codename - Brief description"
git push && git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

### 5. Write Release Notes

Create `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md`:

```markdown
# vX.Y.Z Codename

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Summary

Brief overview of this release.

## New Features

- **0053 - Feature Name**: Description
- **0054 - Feature Name**: Description

## Improvements

- Item 1
- Item 2

## Breaking Changes

- None (or list them)

## Migration Notes

- None required (or list steps)

## Contributors

- Human + AI collaboration via Codev
```

### 6. Create GitHub Release

```bash
gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z Codename" --notes-file docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md
```

### 7. Publish to npm

```bash
cd packages/codev && npm publish
```

### 8. Post to Discussion Forum

Announce the release in GitHub Discussions (Announcements category):

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  createDiscussion(input: {
    repositoryId: "R_kgDOPzIlIw",
    categoryId: "DIC_kwDOPzIlI84CwZYV",
    title: "vX.Y.Z Codename Released",
    body: "<release notes content>"
  }) {
    discussion {
      url
    }
  }
}'
```

Include: summary, new features, breaking changes, migration notes, and install command.

### 9. Update projectlist.md

Update the releases section to mark the new release and assign integrated projects:

```yaml
releases:
  - version: "vX.Y.Z"
    name: "Codename"
    status: released
    target_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
    notes: "Brief description"
```

## Release Naming Convention

Codev releases are named after **great examples of architecture** from around the world:

| Version | Codename | Inspiration |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| 1.0.0 | Alhambra | Moorish palace complex in Granada, Spain |
| 1.1.0 | Bauhaus | German art school, functional modernism |
| 1.2.0 | Cordoba | Great Mosque of Cordoba, Spain |
| 1.3.0 | Doric | Ancient Greek column order, simplicity |

Future releases continue this tradition, drawing from architectural wonders across cultures and eras.

## Semantic Versioning

- **Major** (X.0.0): Breaking changes, major new capabilities
- **Minor** (0.X.0): New features, backward compatible
- **Patch** (0.0.X): Bug fixes only

## Release Candidate (RC) Workflow

Starting with v1.7.0, minor releases use a release candidate workflow for testing before stable release.

### npm Dist-Tags

| Tag | Purpose | Install Command |
|-----|---------|-----------------|
| `latest` | Stable releases (1.6.0, 1.7.0) | `npm install @cluesmith/codev` |
| `next` | Release candidates | `npm install @cluesmith/codev@next` |

**Key behavior**: `npm install @cluesmith/codev` only installs stable versions. RCs are never installed unless explicitly requested.

### RC Publishing

```bash
# Set version to RC
cd packages/codev
npm version 1.7.0-rc.1 --no-git-tag-version

# Commit and tag
cd ../..
git add packages/codev/package.json packages/codev/package-lock.json
git commit -m "v1.7.0-rc.1"
git tag -a v1.7.0-rc.1 -m "v1.7.0-rc.1 - Release candidate"
git push && git push origin v1.7.0-rc.1

# Publish to "next" channel (NOT "latest")
cd packages/codev && npm publish --tag next
```

### RC → Stable Promotion

When an RC is validated and ready for stable release:

```bash
# Bump to stable version
cd packages/codev
npm version 1.7.0 --no-git-tag-version

# Follow standard release process (steps 4-9 above)
```

### Branch Strategy

```
main branch (active development)
    │
    ├── v1.6.0 ────────────────────────────────► npm @latest
    │       │
    │       └── release/1.6.x (created when 1.7.0 ships)
    │               │
    │               └── v1.6.1 (backport) ─────► npm @latest
    │
    ├── v1.7.0-rc.1 ───────────────────────────► npm @next
    ├── v1.7.0-rc.2 ───────────────────────────► npm @next
    └── v1.7.0 ────────────────────────────────► npm @latest
```

### Backporting Bug Fixes

When a bug is found in a stable release after a newer minor version ships:

```bash
# Create release branch from the stable tag (if not exists)
git checkout -b release/1.6.x v1.6.0

# Cherry-pick or implement the fix
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# Bump patch version
cd packages/codev
npm version patch --no-git-tag-version

# Commit, tag, and publish
cd ../..
git add packages/codev/package.json packages/codev/package-lock.json
git commit -m "v1.6.1 - Backport: <fix description>"
git tag -a v1.6.1 -m "v1.6.1 - Backport fix"
git push origin release/1.6.x && git push origin v1.6.1
cd packages/codev && npm publish
```

### When to Use RCs

- **Use RCs** for minor releases (1.7.0, 1.8.0) - allows testing before stable
- **Skip RCs** for patch releases (1.6.1, 1.6.2) - bug fixes go direct to stable
- **Skip RCs** for the current release (1.6.0) - already at stable cadence
